# tbp
Text-based Platformer using Python
This is a tiny fun project I made because I was bored. The entire project took only about 30 to 45 minutes so don't judge the quality :) It might not be fun to play, but it was fun to code. So, for anyone who can't find any regular game to play or has a REALLY trash computer, enjoy!

Requirements:
-Python 3.10 (I used 3.10 while coding but I didn't try with older versions, it might also work with them)
-"keyboard" library (pip install keyboard)
